In this application, Tab bar controller will have two tabs: one named “lunch” and one named “internets”.
• For the first tab, “lunch,” you will create a UICollectionView that will display content
from the JSON data feed found here: 
    http://sandbox.bottlerocketapps.com/BR_iOS_CodingExam_2015_Server/restaurants.json.
• Designed a data model to contain the restaurant objects returned in the JSON feed.
• For the second tab, “internets,” created a simple web browser.
• Upon initial load of your web viewController, it displays URL: http://
www.bottlerocketstudios.com
• Provided support for Back, Next, Refresh functionality as you would see in a full-featured
web browser implementation.
